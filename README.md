## Design

### Colour Scheme

The portfolio uses a minimalist colour palette:

- **Primary text**: #2E2E2E
- **Secondary text**: #7F8C8D
- **Accent**: #4A90E2
- **Background**: #F4F4F4

### Gradients

A linear gradient is applied to both the navigation bar and footer for a modern, subtle look:

- **Navigation Gradient**: left-to-right fade from #4A90E2 to #6EB5FF
- **Footer Gradient**: left-to-right fade from #6EB5FF to #4A90E2

### Additional Graphics

- Logo appears in the nav and footer for branding.
- Project thumbnails visually represent each project where applicable.

## UI

- The layout uses a **max-width main container** for readability.
- Sections are spaced with consistent margins and padding.
- Images are given **rounded corners** and borders for a polished look.
- Media queries ensure the website is **responsive**, stacking content on smaller screens while maintaining alignment and readability.
